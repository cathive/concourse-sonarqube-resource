## [0.6.0.8] - 2018-06-16
- Added support for transfering .m2 folder from project path directory.

## [0.6.0.6] - 2018-06-16
- Fixed support of using custom maven settings.xml with artifactory. -> A change had to be made in Dockerfile and assets/out script.


## [0.6.0] - 2018-05-30

### Removed

- The idea of using a project-local maven wrapper instance seemed nice but
  was not really usable / stable in practice. Therefore the feature had to
  be removed.

## [0.5.1] - 2018-05-30

### Fixed

- An issue with using the maven wrapper was introduced in 0.5.0.
  If a project uses the maven wrapper and the scanner_type is set to `maven`
  (or the scanner_type was automatically detected), such builds were broken,
  because the maven wrapper was not executed correctly.

## [0.5.0] - 2018-05-30

### Fixed

- Anonymous analysis without username/password or access token should now be possible.
  [(#13)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/13)]

### Added

- A new configuration parameter (`source.__debug`) has been added that can be used
  to debug the resource itself when developing new features or fixing bugs.
  (This flag is *not* ment to be used in production environments, though!)

- The unit test framework has been enhanced and it should now be possible to write
  some real proper unit tests using the "bats" framework.

- If the scanner type has been set to `maven` (or if it has been automatically
  determined by the existence of a pom.xml file), the resource will now use the
  installed maven wrapper (if there is an executable `mvww` file in the project's
  root folder).

### Changed

- Starting with this release, the shell scripts will use BASH's double brackets
  syntax for all if-checks, because it's generally less error-prone and and offers
  fewer surprises when dealing with nasty things such as uninitialized variables.

## [0.4.0] - 2018-05-27

### Added

- `sonar.branch.name` can now be auto-detected if `params.autodetect_branch_name` has
  been set to `true`.
  [(#3)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/3)]

### Changed

- Update sonar-scanner-cli to v3.2.0
- Update sonar-maven-plugin to v3.4.0

## [0.3.1] - 2018-05-16

### Fixed

- Multiple additional parameters work now as supposed to.
  [(#14)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/14)]

## [0.3.0] - 2018-03-28

### Added

- Workaround for buggy certificate propagations in Alpine OpenJDK images.
  [(#16)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/16)]

## [0.2.0] - 2018-02-07

### Fixed

- Parameters that contain whitespace characters no longer fail the `out` action.
  [(#6)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/6)]

### Added

- Support for `params.tests`.
  [(#7)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/7)]

- Support for `params.branch_name` and `params.branch_target`.
  Require the [Branch Plugin](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/Branch+Plugin) or
  SonarCloud.

### Changed

- `params.sources` must now be specified as list instead of comma-separated strings

### Removed

- `params.branch` and `params.analysis_mode` are no longer supported.
  (New SonarQube versions handle short-lived branches in a different way)
  Use `params.branch_name` and `params.branch_target` instead if you use the
  Branch plugin.

## [0.0.32] - 2018-01-31

### Fixed

- Support old SonarQube servers that don't report the server version in report-task.txt (Just report "unknown" as server version) [(#11)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/11)]

## [0.0.31] - 2018-01-23

### Fixed

- Support old SonarQube servers that don't report the server version in report-task.txt (under certain conditions, this fix will not work though) [(#11)(https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/11)]

## [0.0.30] - 2018-01-18

### Added

- Support for any additional properties that might need to be passed to the sonar-scanner.

### Fixed

- Updated the documentation to make clear how a quality gate can be used to break the build.
  [(#9)](https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/9)

## [0.0.20] - 2018-01-04

### Added

- Support for SonarQube/SonarCloud organizations. [(#8)](https://github.com/cathive/concourse-sonarqube-resource/issues/8)
